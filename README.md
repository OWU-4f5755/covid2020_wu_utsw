# Investigating the Socioeconomic Impact on Emergency Department Patient Arrivals during COVID 2020: A Comprehensive Time Series Analysis Approach

## Summary
Conducted an analysis that investigates the impact of socioeconomic factors on daily patient arrivals at emergency departments during COVID 2020, identifying patterns and associations using advanced time series techniques.

## Key Features
1. Examined the Health Equity Index (formerly Socioeconomic Needs Index), a measure of socioeconomic need that is correlated with poor health outcomes, to identify areas of highest need and advance equitable outcomes.
2. Employed advanced time series analysis techniques, including ClaSP segmentation and Dynamic Time Warping, to identify structural changes and find optimal alignments between time series.
3. Examined various population patterns, such as changes during the shelter-in-place duration and recovery after, as well as how different socioeconomic groups contribute to the overall trends in daily patient arrivals.
4. Utilized heatmaps and warping path plots, in addition to statistical tests like Pearson correlation, for analysis of several hundred-thousand rows of fairly complex, uncleaned, patient data from EPIC
